- 👋 Hi, I’m @Failah! I really love coding (websites, webapps, and videogames!) and i keep learning new things studying every day!
- 👀 In my knowledge baggage there currently are: HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, TAILWIND, JAVASCRIPT, VUE, REACT, TYPESCRIPT, ANGULAR, PHP, SQL, LARAVEL!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UNITY, while keeping myself trained with JavaScript and its Frameworks!
      I'm developing Neon Snake, which is my modern version of the good old Snake game! You can check my repo and try it yourself, but keep in mind that's in Alpha right        now!
- 💞️ // this is an empty space, for now :P
